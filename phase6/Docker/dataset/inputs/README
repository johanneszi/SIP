Use ptypipe.py python script to run the games with the given input

Samples:
python3 ptypipe.py tetris.in ../tetris
python3 ptypipe.py micro-snake.in ../micro-snake
python3 ptypipe.py c-snake.in ../c-snake

** Note: ptypipe.py is just a sample for piping input to a program, feel free to write your own script if necessary

Since zopfli gets an argument from command line, you don't need to pipe inputs. Simply pass the provided input as a command line argument:
./zopfli zopfli.in
